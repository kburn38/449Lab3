**Earth-like Planets**
------------------

Out of all the planets in space, there are very few planets with similar conditions to ours.

One of the most famous of these Kepler-452b, a super-earth exoplanet in the Kepler-452 system.

While it's not know whether inhabitable or not, it has some of the closest conditions to earth.

This planet, and many like it, may be where we migrate to if earth starts to become uninhabitable.
