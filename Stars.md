**Neutron Stars**
--------------

Neutron stars are the result of massive stars collapsing into a much smaller form.

Neutron stars rapidly spin, creating a cone from the poles of the star, giving them a similar look to pulsars.

Their bright blue hue create some of the prettiest stars in space.

Neutron stars will slowly cool and die out over time.

Take some time to look at them and you will find some very pretty sights.
